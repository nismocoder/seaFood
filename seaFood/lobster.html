                        <div class="lobPic1"></div>
                        <p>The clawed lobster is the most common kind and it is the one that comes to mind first.<br>
                            They have three pairs of claws out of their total five pairs of limbs. These lobsters <br>
                            are especially important for the fishing industry since they are the most widely
                            consumed<br>
                            ones, and they are the ones you expect to be served on a platter when you order in a <br>
                            fancy restaurant.<br><br>

                            This type includes European and American lobsters.

                        <div class="lobPic2"></div>
                        <p>Reef lobsters belong to the genus Enoplometopus, which has 11 species in all. While reef
                            lobsters<br>
                            are also a clawed variety, they are different from clawed lobsters; instead of having claws
                            on <br>
                            three limbs, these lobsters only have one large set of claws on the first one. They are
                            strikingly<br>
                            colored, with some even sporting purple or lavender markings.
                        </p>

                    <div class="lobsterType3">

                        <h1>3. Spiny Lobsters</h1>
                        <div class="lobPic3"></div>
                        <p>This broad category is reserved for all lobsters that lack claws on the front of their
                            bodies, and <br>
                            several species come under this genre. These crustaceans are easily recognizable because of
                            their <br>
                            very thick and oversized antennae; this is where the word ‘spiny’ comes from.<br><br>

                            These crustaceans are nocturnal in nature and feed on algae, snails, crabs, and other small
                            creatures<br>
                            that dwell on the bottom of the ocean floor. If they are present, it means that the ecology
                            around them<br>
                            is sure to be healthy and diverse.<br><br>

                            Spiny lobsters are best known for their mass migration after rainstorms at their place of
                            habitation.

                        <h1>4. Slipper Lobsters</h1>
                        <div class="lobPic4"></div>
                        <p>In slipper lobsters, the front claws are lacking while the antennae are enlarged. Because of
                            their flattened<br>
                            look, it seems like their faces have been squashed. These lobsters hide under the mud during
                            day time instead<br>
                            of lounging in crevices like others, and because of this quality, they are not favored much
                            as food.

                        <div class="lobPic5"></div>
                        <p>One of the main characteristics that give furry lobsters their name is the hair-like
                            protrusions on their<br>
                            bodies that look like actual hair from a distance. These lobsters have large antennae but
                            are small themselves,<br>
                            which makes them stealthy and so they are able to evade most lobster traps.

                        <h1>6. Squat Lobsters</h1>
                        <div class="lobPic6"></div>
                        <p>A unique mix of lobster and shrimp, squat lobsters are not ‘true’ lobsters; they are closer
                            in the family tree to <br>
                            other crustaceans like crabs and hermit crabs. They find their homes in the various cracks
                            and crevices of rocks, <br>
                            but they do dig into sand to find food.<br><br>

                            What makes them especially interesting is the variety and diversity it shows in its
                            coloring. Although there are hundreds<br>
                            of species of squat lobsters, one of the most famous ones is the ‘yeti crab.’
