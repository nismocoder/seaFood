                        <p>The clawed lobster is the most common kind and it is the one that comes to mind first.<br>
                             They have three pairs of claws out of their total five pairs of limbs. These lobsters <br>
                             are especially important for the fishing industry since they are the most widely consumed<br>
                              ones, and they are the ones you expect to be served on a platter when you order in a <br>
                              fancy restaurant.<br><br>

                            This type includes European and American lobsters.

                        <p>Reef lobsters belong to the genus Enoplometopus, which has 11 species in all. While reef lobsters<br>
                             are also a clawed variety, they are different from clawed lobsters; instead of having claws on <br>
                             three limbs, these lobsters only have one large set of claws on the first one. They are strikingly<br>
                              colored, with some even sporting purple or lavender markings.

                        <div class="lobPic3"></div>
                        <p>This broad category is reserved for all lobsters that lack claws on the front of their bodies, and <br>
                            several species come under this genre. These crustaceans are easily recognizable because of their <br>
                            very thick and oversized antennae; this is where the word ‘spiny’ comes from.<br><br>

                            These crustaceans are nocturnal in nature and feed on algae, snails, crabs, and other small creatures<br> 
                            that dwell on the bottom of the ocean floor. If they are present, it means that the ecology around them<br>
                             is sure to be healthy and diverse.<br><br>

                            Spiny lobsters are best known for their mass migration after rainstorms at their place of habitation.

                        <p>In slipper lobsters, the front claws are lacking while the antennae are enlarged. Because of their flattened<br>
                             look, it seems like their faces have been squashed. These lobsters hide under the mud during day time instead<br>
                              of lounging in crevices like others, and because of this quality, they are not favored much as food.

                        <p>One of the main characteristics that give furry lobsters their name is the hair-like protrusions on their<br>
                             bodies that look like actual hair from a distance. These lobsters have large antennae but are small themselves,<br>
                              which makes them stealthy and so they are able to evade most lobster traps.

                        <p>A unique mix of lobster and shrimp, squat lobsters are not ‘true’ lobsters; they are closer in the family tree to <br>
                            other crustaceans like crabs and hermit crabs. They find their homes in the various cracks and crevices of rocks, <br>
                            but they do dig into sand to find food.<br><br>

                            What makes them especially interesting is the variety and diversity it shows in its coloring. Although there are hundreds<br>
                             of species of squat lobsters, one of the most famous ones is the ‘yeti crab.’

                        <p>Also known as Northern bluefin tuna, longtail tuna is a slimmer species. It also has shorter <br>
                            fins than other tuna and so is quite distinguishable.<br><br>

                            Longtail tuna can be found in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It is medium in size,<br>
                             measuring 4 feet long and weighing 80 pounds.<br><br>
                            
                            Unfortunately, longtail tuna are at risk of being overfished. This is because they grow slower<br>
                             and live longer, and so don’t have the reproductive turnover that other types of tuna have.

                        <p>While some tuna are enormous, others, like the blackfin tuna, is much smaller. In fact, these
                            little <br>
                            guys only grow to be 3 feet long and weigh just 45 pounds.

                            Blackfin tuna live in the Atlantic Ocean, but can be found as far north as New York and as
                            far south <br>
                            as Brazil.<br><br>

                            It can take a bit of effort to properly catch a blackfin tuna. While you can use live or
                            artificial <br>

                            a few people.

                        <p>The king of tuna, Pacific bluefin tuna is a massive fish. In fact, it can grow up to 10 feet <br>
                            long and weigh up to 1000 pounds.<br><br>

                            While there are many types of tuna, as we will see in this article, when most people think of <br>
                            tuna, this is the species that comes to mind.<br><br>
                            
                            There are many interesting tidbits about Pacific bluefin tuna. They are a pelagic fish, which <br>
                            means that instead of swimming near the bottom of the ocean floor or by the shore, they instead <br>
                            swim in the open water.<br><br>
                            
                            Pacific bluefin tuna are prized for their delicious taste and are a staple with sashimi. In fact,<br>
                             the market is so high for them in Japan that they are often bid on at exorbitant prices.

                            Other characteristics of skipjack tuna include dark lines on their bellies. They are small in size,<br>

                            You can find skipjack tuna in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. While you can eat skipjack <br>
                            tuna whole, it is often canned instead. If you see a can of tuna labeled “chunk light tuna” then it <br>

                        <div class="tunaPic11"></div>
                        <p>Unlike traditional skipjack tuna, black skipjack tuna is a very bony fish. In fact, unlike other fish, whose skeleton is <br>
                            made from softer cartilage, this species actually has bone for their skeleton.<br><br>

                            While you may encounter black skipjack tuna on your fishing adventures, it is not a fish that most people eat. There just<br>
                             isn’t enough meat on it to warrant all the effort.<br><br>
                            
                            You also won’t find black skipjack tuna at a fish market.

                        <div class="tunaPic12"></div>
                        <p>Popular in the Western Pacific Ocean, bigeye tuna are a close cousin to yellowfin tuna and are often confused with each <br>
                            other. In fact, both these species are classified as ahi tuna.<br><br>

                            Bigeye tuna actually have larger eyes than other tuna, especially yellowfin, which is how they received their name.<br>
                            
                            While not as large as some of the massive species of tuna, bigeye tuna can still be quite impressive. They can be 7 feet<br>
                             long and sometimes weigh over 400 pounds.

                        <div class="tunaPic13"></div>
                        <p>Like all bluefin tuna species, the Southern bluefin tuna is a heavily prized fish. It is targeted for its size and taste,<br>
                             and as a result its population has dramatically declined in the past decades.<br><br>

                            The overfishing of Southern bluefin tuna is linked to technological advances in the fishing industry, including satellite<br>
                             imagery and GPS. The result is that there are now strict restrictions on how many pounds of fish each country is able to catch.<br><br>
                            
                            Southern bluefin tuna are large, though not as big as other bluefin species. They can be up to 600 pounds in size and 8 feet in<br>
                             length. You can find Southern bluefin tuna in the Southern Hemisphere.

                        <p>Similar to other bluefin species, the Atlantic bluefin tuna is a very large fish. It can grow above 1000 pounds and is prized<br>
                             for its meat.<br><br>

                            This species is so prized that is has become a very lucrative business for fisheries. In particular, the Japanese raw-fish <br>
                            market regularly bids for these enormous fish. Sushi and sashimi dishes will often include Atlantic bluefin tuna.<br><br>
                            
                            Unfortunately, what sets Atlantic bluefin tuna apart from other species has led to its downfall.<br><br>
                            
                            It is on its way to being overfished and there are now many regulations about how it is caught, although some scientists believe<br>
                             further action needs to be taken to preserve this species.

                        <p>Frigate tuna are quite small in size, and usually only grow to be 25 inches in length and weigh 3 to 4 pounds.<br><br>

                            You will find frigate tuna in many oceans around the world, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans because they are a<br>
                             highly migratory species, and therefore are always on the move.
