                            <p> A topping, usually fish, served on top of sushi rice. <br>

                                <br>
                                flavor of the fish, shellfish, or other toppings
                            </p>

                            <h1>2. Sashimi</h1>
                            <div class="sashimi"></div>
                            <p>Fish or shellfish served alone (no rice). <br>
                                This is best for people who really love to taste the fish or shellfish since it
                                comes<br>
                                with nothing else.
                            </p>

                            <h1>3. Maki</h1>
                            <div class="maki"></div>
                            <p>Rice and filling wrapped in seaweed. <br>
                                This is what most people think of when they think of sushi rolls
                            </p>

                            <h1>4. Uramaki</h1>
                            <div class="uramaki"></div>
                            <p>Similar to the above, but rice is on the outside and seaweed wraps around the filling.
                                <br>
                                These rolls often have lots of toppings and sauces — they may either be cooked or raw.
                            </p>

                            <h1>5. Temaki</h1>
                            <div class="temaki"></div>
                            <p>Sushi that has been hand-rolled into a cone shape. <br>
                                The cones are not as easy to share as the rolls (though very delicious!)
                            </p>

                            <h1>6. Temari</h1>
                            <div class="temari"></div>
                            <p> Temari sushi is made with a mix of colorful toppings and sushi rice that are <br>
                                formed into ball shapes.
                            </p>

                            <h1>7. Chirashi</h1>
                            <div class="chirashi"></div>
                            <p> Chirashizushi literally means ‘scattered sushi’. <br>
                                Instead of the typically formed sushi, you get a colorful mix of ingredients<br>
                                scattered over the sushi rice that is served in a Hangiri or a large serving platter.
                            </p>

                        <p>The question of what is sushi grade fish comes up a lot and no one seems to accurately answer that question.<br>
                             After some research I am now able to provide information as to the guidelines and regulations that are followed<br>
                              in the seafood industry in terms of serving raw seafood. As for micro standards for sushi or sashimi grade <br>
                              seafood, I have spoken with many in the seafood industry who supply ‘sushi grade’ fish for sushi and sashimi<br>
                               served at restaurants and they all give me the same answer… they do not know of any regulations from either<br>
                                the FDA or any other agencies regarding ‘sushi grade’ seafood, which is why suppliers have set up their own<br>
                                 micro and chemical parameters for their products. A personal search of FDA documents turns up the same <br>
                                 results, no clear standards as to what makes fish ‘sushi grade’ or ‘sashimi grade’ and no definition of <br>
                                 the term.<br><br>
                                 The only concern any inspectors have is referred to as the parasite destruction guarantee, which is <br>
                                 accomplished by ‘freezing and storing seafood at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or freezing<br>
                                  at -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or freezing at <br>
                                  -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours’ which is sufficient <br>
                                  to kill parasites. The FDA’s Food Code recommends these freezing conditions to retailers who provide fish <br>
                                  intended for raw consumption (for further information, please visit the FDA website). Some exceptions to <br>
                                  that rule are bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna, and farmed salmon. I know that is a mouthful, but it’s the facts.<br>
                                   Other than a few specific organisms of concern for some seafood, sashimi standards are set as any other <br>
                                   ready-to-eat item, e.g. sushi. This means that, aside from the FDA recommendations and local Health <br>
                                   Department requirements, there are no laws or recommendations for “sushi/sashimi grade” fish. It is no more<br>
                                    than a marketing term.

                            <li>Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to raise the levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the blood <br>
                                (the “good” cholesterol). This, in turn, can lower the amount of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in the <br>
                                blood. In some cases, a person’s LDL can be raised slightly, however with a greater rise in HDL, a person’s<br>
                                 ‘ratio’ can improve tremendously, which is an overall positive change to cardiovascular health. Omega-3 <br>
                                 fatty acids have also been shown to increase the particle size of the LDL in your blood, which is also <br>
                                 considered a positive and healthful change.</li>
                            <li>The consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to be beneficial to those with type II <br>
                                diabetes, helping moderate blood sugar levels and epidemiologic studies have shown a lower prevalence<br>
                                 of impaired glucose tolerance.</li>
                            <li>Studies have also linked the consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids with improved endothelial (blood vessel wall)<br>
                                 function, reduced platelet aggregability (blood clotting), and lower blood pressure. These are widely <br>
                                 regarded cardioprotective benefits.</li>
                                 <li>Also remember that your central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and all nerve sheaths) is mostly<br>
                                     DHA, an Omega-3 fatty acid. The body is constantly in need of repairing and replenishing itself, so <br>
                                     the consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids is critical to maintaining proper central nervous system health.</li>
                                     <li>Since Omega-3 fatty acids are required for proper development (which includes developing babies),<br>
                                         pregnant and lactating women are encouraged to eat foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly<br>
                                          DHA and EPA. This includes many nuts and seeds, however fish is the richest source of these fatty<br>
                                           acids and a great way to incorporate them into your diet. Raw fish is often avoided in western <br>
                                           society during pregnancy, so nutritional supplements are sold specifically to target pregnant and<br>
                                            lactating women, which are either fish oil or Omega-3 fatty acids taken directly from the algal <br>
                                            source, specifically one called Neuromins, and sold as Expecta Lipil, among many others. If you<br>
                                             can’t have the fish, you can have the next best thing. But remember, there is still plenty of <br>
                                             cooked fish available if you choose.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Today, Omega-3 fatty acids are considered quite beneficial to cardiovascular health and seafood consumption is<br>
                             suggested by doctors the world around. Many people now take Omega-3 supplements, generally called ‘fish oil’ or<br>
                              “Omega 3 Oil,” to incorporate more of these fatty acids into their diet, which is perfectly fine, however we <br>
                              would like to remind our readers that deep, cold water fish are also excellent sources of Omega-3 fatty acids,<br>
                               and tasty too, so keep eating that sushi!</p>

                        <p>The Beginnings of Sushi<br><br>
                            Sushi has been around for a surprisingly long period of time, although not in its present form. The history of<br>
                             sushi is an interesting tale of the evolution of a simple dish. What was to become sushi was first mentioned <br>
                             in China in the second century A.D. Originally, sushi arose out of a way of preserving food. Fish was placed <br>
                             in rice and allowed to ferment, which allowed an individual to keep the fish edible for some time. The rice <br>
                             was thrown away and the fish was eaten when needed or wanted.<br>
                            The method spread throughout China and by the seventh century, had made its way to Japan, where seafood has <br>
                            historically been a staple. The Japanese, however, took the concept further and began to eat the rice with the<br>
                             fish. Originally, the dish was prepared in much the same manner. In the early 17th century, however, Matsumoto<br>
                              Yoshiichi of Edo (now Tokyo) starting seasoning the rice with rice wine vinegar while making his ‘sushi’ for <br>
                              sale. This allowed the dish to be eaten immediately, instead of waiting the months it might normally take to <br>
                              prepare the ‘sushi.’<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p>The Evolution of Sushi<br><br>
                            In the early 19th century, a man by the name of Hanaya Yohei conceived a major change in the production and<br>
                             presentation of his sushi. No longer wrapping the fish in rice, he placed a piece of fresh fish on top of an <br>
                             oblong shaped piece of seasoned rice. Today, we call this style ‘nigiri sushi’ (finger sushi) or “edomae sushi”<br>
                              (from Edo, the name of Tokyo at the time) and is now the common way of eating Japanese sushi. At that time, <br>
                              sushi was served from sushi stalls on the street and was meant to be a snack or quick bite to eat on the go.<br>
                               Served from his stall, this was not only the first of the real ‘fast food’ sushi, but quickly became wildly <br>
                               popular. From his home in Edo, this style of serving sushi rapidly spread throughout Japan, aided by the Great<br>
                                Kanto earthquake in 1923, as many people lost their homes and businesses and moved from Tokyo.<br><br><br>

                               
                                    After World War Two, the sushi stalls were shut down and moved indoors, to more sanitary conditions. More<br>
                                     formal seating was later provided (the first iterations were merely an indoor version of the sushi stalls)<br>
                                      and sushi changed from ‘fast food’ to a true dining experience. Sushi spread around the globe, and with <br>
                                      the advent of the promotion of seafood, this unusual style of serving fish was quickly adopted by western<br>
                                       cultures, always eager for something new, especially something that had grown as sophisticated and unique <br>
                                       as sushi.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Modern Sushi<br><br>
                            Sushi, the artful dining experience once uniquely Japanese, has now evolved to another level beyond the traditional <br>
                            Japanese methods. Western influences have given rise to new styles of sushi, such as California rolls and the many <br>
                            elaborate ‘fusion’ creations at upscale sushi restaurants. The history of sushi is a long one, at least 1,800 years <br>
                            in fact, but the current iteration is popular around the world, and rightly so. It is not often that something so singly<br>
                             cultural can not only take the world by storm, but also influence the direction of food in other cultures. Demand for <br>
                             sushi is only increasing and seems to be continuing to evolve. Traditional sushi restaurants sit alongside ‘fusion’ <br>
                             restaurants and both are popular for their own reasons. The history of sushi is still far from over.
